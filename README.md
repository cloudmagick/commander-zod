# commander-zod

## Build Validated, Type-safe, CLI Tools

This is a lightweight extension for [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander), adding a layer of validation and static typing for Typescript using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). Commander is one of the most prolific tools on npm, having been around for over 10 years, it is still actively maintained, and as of early March 2022 has only **4 open GitHub issues of a total 855 closed**! Now with Zod validation and Typescript support it should be even easier to build CLI tools that help standardize, automate, and improve your workflows.

## ClI Workflows

The repo includes additional packages that can be ussed together to quickly build out CLI projects for your team.
